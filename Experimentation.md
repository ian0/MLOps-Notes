#### Jupyter Notebooks or Jupyter Lab
Local or ssh into server: Allows users to compile all aspects of a data project in one place making it easier to show the entire process of a project to your intended audience. Through the web-based application, users can create data visualizations and other components of a project to share with others

#### Jupyter Hub
JupyterHub brings the power of notebooks to groups of users. It gives users access to computational environments and resources without burdening the users with installation and maintenance tasks.

JupyterHub runs in the cloud or on your own hardware, and makes it possible to serve a pre-configured data science environment to any user.

#### Kubeflow Notebooks
Kubeflow Notebooks provides a way to run web-based development environments inside your Kubernetes cluster by running them inside Pods.

Some key features include:

-   Native support for [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), [RStudio](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), and [Visual Studio Code (code-server)](https://github.com/cdr/code-server).
-   Users can create notebook containers directly in the cluster, rather than locally on their workstations.
