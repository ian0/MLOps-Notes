[[Experiment Tracking and model management]]
## MLFlow

MLflow is an open source platform to manage the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility,              
deployment, and a central model registry. MLflow currently offers four components:

-   MLflow Tracking: Record and query experiments: code, data, config, and results
-   MLflow Projects: Package data science code in a format to reproduce runs on any platform
-   MLflow Models: Deploy machine learning models in diverse serving environments
-   Model Registry: Store, annotate, discover, and manage models in a central repository
