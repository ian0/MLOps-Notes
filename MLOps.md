## Why?

#### - Only when we can get models into production do they start to create value. 

#### - Traditionally, machine learning has been approached from a perspective of individual scientific experiments predominantly carried out in isolation by data scientists. 

#### - MLOps is the assembly line of Machine Learning. It allows us to create practices around model reproducibility, validation, versioning, deployment and monitoring. It facilates collaberation and experimental programming which then improves the speed of innovation.
